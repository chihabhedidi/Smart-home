# About

The Smart Home project is an application developed using C# and .NET Remoting, with the DevExpress framework for the interface. The project is designed to provide users with a secure and convenient way to control and monitor their home environment. It is connected to an Arduino ESP32 device with a DHT11 sensor to collect temperature and humidity information from the home.

The application has two types of users - an admin and a regular user, who could be a family member or a friend. The admin has full control over the system, including the ability to add or remove users, configure settings, and monitor the system's status. Regular users can use the system to monitor the temperature and humidity levels in their home, as well as control various aspects of their smart home.

To ensure security, the application requires users to enter a password to access the system. The password is used to unlock the door and allow users to enter. The system keeps track of user information and stores it in a SQL Server database for easy access and management.

The user interface of the Smart Home application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear indications of the current temperature and humidity levels.
